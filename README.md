SimpleJsonParser
================

A simple sequential Json Parser for C++.
It does not do any validating of Json files so make sure that the file is valid beforehand. 
main.cpp has several different tests for the parser and shows how to use the parser.
The Json Writer was put together in a few minutes, it works but my main focus was the parser.
I made this as a tool to use in one of my games I was working on.
